# discordcryptobot
This bot will alert you of Eth/Btc price changes. Self explanatory script, reach out to me if you have any issues.



This bot uses the CoinMarketCap API (https://coinmarketcap.com/api/) to retrieve the current prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum in USD. It checks if either price is greater than a specified threshold (in this case, PRICE_ALERT_THRESHOLD) and sends an alert message to the specified Discord channel if a significant price change is detected.

To use this bot, you will need to replace YOUR_COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY with your own CoinMarketCap API key, YOUR_CHANNEL_ID with the ID of the Discord channel
